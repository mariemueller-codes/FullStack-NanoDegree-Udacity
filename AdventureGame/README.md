Adventure Game Project for Udacity's Web Nanodegree Programs

# General Info
This is to demonstrate basic python skills by making a simple version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. The key features for this game are as follows:
* The game must give the player a choice and narrative of what is happening in the game
* Everytime the player made a choice, something different happens
* The game must include randomness
* It must have conditions for winning and losing
* When it is game over, the game must ask if the play wants to play again

The following are basic requirements for this project:
* Output text to the console
* Import modules such as time.sleep function (to create delays between messages) and random.choice so that each game is different in some way
* Input function for interactive component of the game
* Conditional statements
* Use a conditional loop to handle invalid input
* Refactor code that includes at least four functions
* Each functions should have a single purpose and a name that describes that purpose
* Program must follows that standard Python style guide (pycodestyle reports zero errors and zero warnings)
* Program is a playable game, and runs from start to finish without crashing or displaying errors.
* Avoid using global variables in the functions
